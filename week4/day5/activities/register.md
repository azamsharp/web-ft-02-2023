# Activity 2 - Registration Screen

Create a registration form which will take the following data from the user: 
```
- First Name 

- Last Name 

- Email 

- Password 
```

The form must validate for the following constraints: 

- First Name, Last Name, Email and Password cannot be blank 

- Email *format* must be a valid email. This means johndoe@domainname.com is good but johndoe@.com is not good. 

- Password should not be displayed when the user types in the text box
