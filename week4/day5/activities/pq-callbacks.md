# Practice Questions - Callbacks 

Create a function called delay that accepts two arguments: a callback function and a delay time in milliseconds. The function should use setTimeout to delay the execution of the callback function by the specified delay time.

Create a function called repeat that accepts two arguments: a callback function and an interval time in milliseconds. The function should use setInterval to repeatedly execute the callback function at the specified interval time.

Create a function called filter that accepts two arguments: an array of values and a callback function. The function should use the callback function to filter the array and return a new array that contains only the values that pass the filter.

Create a function called map that accepts two arguments: an array of values and a callback function. The function should use the callback function to map each value in the array to a new value, and return a new array that contains the mapped values.

Create a function called reduce that accepts three arguments: an array of values, a callback function, and an initial value. The function should use the callback function to reduce the array to a single value by iterating over each value in the array and using the callback function to combine it with the previous value. The initial value should be used as the starting value for the reduction.
