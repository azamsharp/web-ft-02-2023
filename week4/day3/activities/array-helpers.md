# Activity 3 - Array Helpers

1) Use a map function to return an array which will return a double of each number. 

**Example:** 
```
input: [1,2,3,4] 

output: [1,4,6,8] 
```
2) Use the filter function to return even numbers from an array 

**Example:** 
```
input: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10]

output: [2,4,6,8,10]
```
3) Use the find function to return the object with name is "Jay" 

**Example:** 
```
input:

let users = [
  {name: "Jay", age: 34}, 
  {name: "John", age: 20}, 
  {name: "Mary", age: 45}
]
output: 

{name: "Jay", age: 34}
```
