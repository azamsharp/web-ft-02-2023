In this activity, you are going to learn about Template Literals. 

Create an app which consists of two textboxes, one for movie name and other for movie poster URL. 

When user enters the movie name and url and presses the submit button, a new movie item is added to the page. The movie item will be dynamically created and added to the page. 

```
<div>
    <h3>Spiderman</h3>
    <img src="urltoanymovieposter" />
</div>
```

In your HTML, add a placeholder where movie item will be added. 

```
 <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="movieItem">
        </div>
    </body>
 </html>
```
