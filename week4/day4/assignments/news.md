# Assignment 2 - News API

Your task is to display news to the user. The news.zip file (attached) already has a JSON formatted object which contains the news. Create a page which displays the following information related to the news. 

```
author
title
description
url (hyperlink to go to the news)
urlToImage (image associated with the news) 
publishedAt
```

**HARD MODE:** 

- There is a js file called "sources.js" in the attached download. Use that file to display all the sources. When the user clicks on a particular source then show the user news from that source. If there is no news for the source then display no news found. 


**HARDER MODE:** 

- Only display the sources which contains at least one news item.
