# Activity - Writing JSON File

1) Create an application where you will ask the user their name and age, when they enter their name and age you will create a JSON document (person.json) which looks like this: 

```
{
    "name": "nameoftheperson",
    "age": 34
}
```

 

2) Create an application which repeatedly asks the user for their name and age and then put all the information in a JSON file called `users.json`. The final JSON file may look like this: 

```
[{
		"name": "johndoe",
		"age": 34
	},
	{
		"name": "marydoe",
		"age": 29
	}

]
```
