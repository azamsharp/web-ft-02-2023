# Advent of Code 2020 Challenges (from a real coding challenge!)

1. You are given a list. You don't know how long the list is or where it came from, but you know that two values on the list should sum to 2020. You need to find those values, then multiply them to get the answer.

##### Did you spot that the values your program should add together are actually on lines 28 and 29? If you're stuck, don't be afraid to figure out the right answer and work back.

2. Good job! Now, you need to find out which of these passwords are considered valid. But wait, you say, what makes a password valid? Great question! A valid password in this paradigm is one that has at least 2 instances of the required letter, and it fits within the password length prompts. Someone setting up this password validation program should be able to input a custom required letter and both the maximum and minimum lengths for passwords.
