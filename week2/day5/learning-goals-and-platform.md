Today's Goals:
* Get comfortable with algorithms!
* Get comfortable writing functions in general, and in using one function as part of another!

Remember, [functions](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/handling-user-input/javascript-101/#functions) are the backbone of coding - they're how you can really use code with algorithms. If I challenged you to make a function that took the parameters of a square's height and length, could you use those to calculate its area?
