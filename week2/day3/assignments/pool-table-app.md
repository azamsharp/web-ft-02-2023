# Assignment - Pool Table (Multi-Day Project)

You have just been hired by University of Houston as a developer. Your first task is to create a pool table management app which will manage the pool tables in University Center Games Room. 

Here are the requested features: 

- As an admin you should be able to see all the tables (12) 

- As an admin each table in the list should show, whether the table is OCCUPIED or NOT OCCUPIED. 

- As an admin if the table is OCCUPIED then show the start time of the table, number of minutes played. (Hardmode - If the minutes are > 60 then show them in terms of hours) 

- As an admin you can only give out the tables that are NOT OCCUPIED. This means if pool table 8 is occupied and you try to give it out then the app will print a message saying `"Pool Table 8 is currently occupied"`. 

- As an admin whenever I close the table it should write an entry in the text file / json file. The file should be named in the following format: `(11-22-2017.txt or 11-22-2017.json)` keeping track of all the tables. The entry can consists of the following information:
