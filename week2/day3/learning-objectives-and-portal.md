Today's Goals:
* Get comfortable using loops to cycle through inputs
* Use files as both inputs and outputs for your code
* Ask users for input directly

If you're stuck, remember to check what the [three parts of a loop are](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/solving-problems-using-code/intro-to-python/#how-do-i-repeat-a-piece-of-code-over-and-over) and that [reading and writing files with code](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/solving-problems-using-code/mapping/#how-do-i-save-to-a-file) is an important skill!
