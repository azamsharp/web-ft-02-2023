# Activity - Employee Raise Unit Test


Write a class called Employee. The `__init__` method should take in a first name, a last name and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called `give_raise()` that adds $5000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount. 

 

Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, `test_give_default_raise()` and `test_give_custom_raise()`. The the setUp method so you don't have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
