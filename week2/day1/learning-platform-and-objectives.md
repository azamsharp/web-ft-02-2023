Today's Goals:

* Getting more comfortable with Object-Oriented programming ideas
* Getting more comfortable using Classes, which allow us to construct an Object and give it properties
* Learn how we can use those properties to mutate (change) an Object

If you're stuck, check out the [Learning Portal's Classes and Objects](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/solving-problems-using-code/object-oriented-programming/#classes-and-objects) section for help!
