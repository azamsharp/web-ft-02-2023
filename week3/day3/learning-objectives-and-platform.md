Daily Goals:
* Get more comfortable using Flexbox and the Grid Module to position your HTML!
* Start thinking about ways that nesting styles can work!

Remember, the [Grid Module](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/front-end-foundations/grid-layout/#overview) is a great alternative to [Flexbox](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/immersive/lessons/front-end-foundations/flexbox/#item-properties) when you want the size of all your HTML elements to be linked to each other, not just the page size.
