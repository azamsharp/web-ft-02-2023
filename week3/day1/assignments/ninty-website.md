# Assignment - Create 90's Style Website 

**Create a basic website!**

- Start with the home page at index.html
- Create pages for individual topics. These can your interest, passions, family, cats, or anything else.
- Link the different pages to one another (via nav or links in the content).
- Include images
- Make use of tags you learned
- Make use of CSS styling
- Make sure all your html page are validated via plugin (or you can always upload your HTML file here.)
- Make 5-10 different pages. Put good content in them
 
**A few ideas:**

- Document a few of the python projects you created with screenshots, pre-formatted code, and a brief description.
- Create a hypertext version of notes you've taken during class, including links to external resources.
- Create a (hopefully non-creepy) fan page for something you love.

Though we will explore more HTML and CSS in upcoming lessons, don't be afraid to use tags and styles we haven't gone over!
