# Driver License Application Form

Create an HTML form for a driver's license application. Your task is to include fields for the applicant's personal information and ensure that proper validation is implemented for each field. Here are the details of what needs to be included and validated:

1. Full Name:
   - Ensure that the field is not empty and contains only letters (no numbers or special characters).

2. Date of Birth:
   - Verify that the date is a valid date and the applicant is of legal age to apply for a driver's license.

3. Address:
   - Confirm that the address is not empty and may contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, commas, and other standard address punctuation.

4. Email:
   - Ensure that the email follows a valid format.

5. Phone Number:
   - Verify that the phone number follows a valid format, considering country-specific formats.

6. License Type:
   - Ensure that a license type is selected.

7. Social Security Number (SSN):
   - Confirm that the SSN follows the correct format (e.g., xxx-xx-xxxx).

Your HTML form should incorporate appropriate HTML attributes and possibly JavaScript validation to enforce these requirements. Test your form thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected and provides helpful error messages when invalid data is entered.
