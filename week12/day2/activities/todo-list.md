# Activity 2 - Todo List 

In this activity, you will create a TodoList app. The TodoList app will consist of a single TextBox and a Button. 

When user enters task (mow the lawn) then the private state gets populated with the task name. 

When the user presses the submit button then the task is added to the global Redux state called tasks (tasks[]) and gets displayed on the screen.
