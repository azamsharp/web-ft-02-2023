# ExpressJS Exercises 

Sure, here are 5 Express.js programming exercises for a junior developer:

1. Create an Express.js application that serves a static HTML file. The HTML file should include a form that accepts a username and password. When the user submits the form, the server should authenticate the user by checking if the username and password match a pre-defined set of credentials.

2. Create an Express.js application that connects to a MongoDB database and displays a list of items from the database. Allow the user to add new items to the database using a form.

3. Create an Express.js application that implements a RESTful API for managing a list of todos. The API should allow the user to create, read, update, and delete todos. Use the `body-parser` middleware to parse JSON data from requests.

4. Create an Express.js application that implements a WebSocket server. The server should broadcast a message to all connected clients whenever a new client connects or disconnects.

5. Create an Express.js application that implements an authentication system using passport.js. Allow users to log in using a username and password, and display a message indicating whether the login was successful or not.

6. Create an Express.js application that implements a file upload feature using the `multer` middleware. Allow users to upload files and store them in a designated directory on the server.

7. Create an Express.js application that implements a chatroom using Socket.IO. Allow users to join the chatroom and send messages to other users in real time.

8. Create an Express.js application that implements a simple blog system. Allow users to create new blog posts, read existing posts, and comment on posts. Use a MongoDB database to store the blog posts and comments.

9. Create an Express.js application that implements a shopping cart system. Allow users to add items to their cart, remove items from their cart, and view their cart. Use sessions to store the user's shopping cart data.

10. Create an Express.js application that implements a simple weather app. Allow users to enter a city name and display the current weather conditions for that city. Use an API such as OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather data.

11. Create an Express.js application that implements a URL shortener. Allow users to enter a long URL and generate a shortened URL that redirects to the original URL when visited.

12. Create an Express.js application that implements a file sharing system. Allow users to upload files to the server and generate a shareable link that others can use to download the file.

13. Create an Express.js application that implements a simple quiz game. Load quiz questions and answers from a JSON file, and allow users to answer the questions and receive feedback on their answers.

14. Create an Express.js application that implements a currency converter. Allow users to enter an amount in one currency and convert it to another currency using exchange rates retrieved from an API.

15. Create an Express.js application that implements a real-time dashboard. Use WebSockets to push updates to the dashboard whenever new data is available, such as stock prices or weather forecasts.
