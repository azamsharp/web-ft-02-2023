# Assignment - Weather App

In this assignment you are going to the use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the live weather.

Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and register for a free account. OpenWeatherMap will send you an email with all the required information on how to access their API. 

Use a similar endpoint to fetch the weather details and fetch the min temperature, max temperature, pressure and the name of the city. 

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=houston,uk&appid=YOURAPIKEY&units=imperial

Allow the user to type in the name of the city so you can search for weather using that city name. 

**HARD MODE:**

Apart from providing the user to enter the name of the city, automatically find the coordinates (lat and long) of the user and use that to fetch the weather information based on the current location of the user. 

**USE YOUR OWN API KEY BUT IF YOUR KEY DOES NOT WORK THEN USE IT**
