Shawn 8  , 5
Megan 13  8 

## After 2 Weeks (Delivered)

- Login Screen (13) 
- Registration Screen (8) 
- User should be allowed to add stores (13)
- User should be allowed to delete stores (8)

- Retrospect 
    - 3 things that went well in the sprint
    - 3 things that we can improve 

Velocity = 13 + 8 + 13 + 8 = 42 

## Week 3 & Week 4 (Delivered)

Velocity = 8 + 8 + 8 + 13 = 37 
- Retrospect 

## Week 5 & Week 6 (Delivered)

Velocity = 13 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 39 

Average velocity = (42 + 37 + 39) / 3 = 39

Demo should be done NOT hosted on your computer but hosted on a development/demo server 

Story = 13 
Story = 8 
Story = 13 
Story = 8 
Story = 5 
Story = 13 
Story = 8 

Backlog means all the stories product teams needs to be done. Backlog can be in 1000s of stories. 

- A user should able to locate all stores near their position 
 

Icebox are simply ideas from the product team. They still needs to be investigated.
