# Activity 2 - Session

Create an Express Mustache app which will ask for user's name and age using a TextBox. When the user submits the form the name and age is placed in request session. 

After submitting the form user is taken to a different page where the name and age is display on the page. 

**Suggested Routes:** 

- /register - GET - Takes the user to a page which shows a TextBox for name and age 

- /register - POST - Route on which the name and age is posted 

- /confirm - GET - After the user submits the form he/she is taken to the confirm page which shows their name and age
