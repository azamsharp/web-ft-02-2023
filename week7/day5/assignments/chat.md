# Assignment - Trips (Register, Login and Chat)

You are in charge of creating a website for tracking trips. You will use server side pages using Mustache or any other server side template framework for this assignment. 

Your app should allow users to do the following: 

- Ability to add a new trip. A new trip consists of title, image, date of departure, date of return 

- Ability to view all the trips (A sample screenshot is shown below) 

- Ability to delete a trip 

- Add the ability to allow user to register for the website 

- Allow the user to login to the website 

- Allow the user to signout from the website 

- Allow the user to only see their trips after they login successfully

**- Allow the users to join a chat room where they can chat with other users.** 

**- Display username along with the chat messages** 

* Your app should work on mobile devices

 **HARD MODE:** 

- Display the number of users joined in the chat room 

- When the user join a chat room, then he/she gets the complete chat history of the chat

 

* Google Trips is a good app for inspiration and ideas! (Available on the App Store)
