# Assignment - TODO List Web API Using Node


In this project you are responsible for creating the Web API for TODO app using Node. 

Your API will expose the following endpoints: 

- Get all TODO items (/todos) 
- Save a new TODO item (/todos)  

Each TODO item consists of the title, priority, date created

You are also responsible for creating the User Interface for your app which will consume the API. 

**HARD MODE:** 

- Ability to delete an existing TODO item - /todos DELETE 

- Ability to update an existing TOD item 

* Creating a class for TODO list item is not mandatory but it is a good practice.
