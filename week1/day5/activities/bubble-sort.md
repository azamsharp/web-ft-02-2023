# Activity - Bubble Sort

Write an application which applies the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list/array of numbers. 

Your app should start with an integer array similar to this: 

`numbers = [2,1,45,67,89,4,5,7,9]`

After applying bubble sort you will end up with the sorted array. 

`[1,2,4,5,7,9,45,67,89]   (Ascending Order)` 

You can also sort the array in decending order as shown below: 

`[89,67,45,9,7,5,4,2,1]`


* Hint: You may need two loops to perform bubble sort
