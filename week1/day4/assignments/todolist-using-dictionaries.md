# TodoList Using Objects 

In this assignment you are going to create a TODO app. When the app launch, ask the user for their choice. 

If user enters 1 then allow them to add a new task 
If user enters 2 then alow them to delete the task 
If user enters 3 then allow them to view all tasks 
If user enters q then quit the app 

**Add Task:** 

Ask the user for the 'title' and 'priority' of the task. Priority can be high, medium and low. 

**Delete Task:** (HARD MODE) 

Show user all the tasks along with the index number of each task. User can then enter the index number of the task to delete the task. 

**View all tasks:**

Allow the user to view all the tasks in the following format: 

1 - Wash the car - high 

2 - Mow the lawn - low 

 

* Store each task in an object and use 'title' and 'priority' as keys of the object. 

* Store each object inside an array. Array will represent list of tasks.  


** HINT ** 

let tasks = [] // You can create a tasks array at the very top of your file
