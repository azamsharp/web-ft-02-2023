List Exercises
 
Sum the Numbers
Given an list of numbers, print their sum. When I say given something, just make something up and store it in a variable.

Largest Number
Given an list of numbers, print the largest of the numbers.

Smallest Number
Given an list of numbers, print the smallest of the numbers.

Even Numbers
Given an list of numbers, print each number in the list that is even.

Positive Numbers
Given an list of numbers, print each number in the list that is greater than zero.

Positive Numbers II
Given an list of numbers, create a new list which contains every number in the given list which is positive.

Multiply a list
Given an list of numbers, and a single factor (also a number), create a new list consisting of each of the numbers in the first list multiplied by the factor. Print the new list out to the screen.

Multiply Vectors
Given two lists of numbers of the same length, create a new list by multiplying the pairs of numbers in corresponding positions in the two lists. Example:

[2, 4, 5] x [2, 3, 6] = [4, 12, 30]

Matrix Addition
Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 two dimensional list is represented as an list of lists:

[ [2, -2],
  [5, 3] ]
Calculate the result of adding the two matrices. The number in each position in the resulting matrix should be the sum of the numbers in the corresponding addend matrices. Example: to add

1 3
2 4
and

5 2
1 0
results in

6 5
3 4
Matrix Addition II
Use your solution in Matrix Addition, and extend it to work for a pair of matrices of any size, as long as they have the same size.

De-dup
Given an list of numbers or strings, create a new list containing the same elements as the first list, except with any duplicate values removed. Print the list.

Bonus: Matrix Multiplication
Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 - calculate the result of multiplying the two matrices. Print the resulting matrix.
