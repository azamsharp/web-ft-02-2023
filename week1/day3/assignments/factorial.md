# Assignment:  Factorial 

Assignment 1 - Write an app which asks users for a number input and then prints the factorial for that number. 

----------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment: Palindrome 

Create an app which detects if the input word is a palindrome or not. 

Palindromes are strings which when read from left to right are same as right to left. Examples below: 
```
mom 

dad 

madam 
```

The following strings are NOT palindrome: 

```
cat != tac 

car != rac 

bus = sub 
```

* Hint - You can loop through a String. A String can be accessed like an array. 

`word = "Car" -> word[1] = "a"`

---------------------------------------------------------

## Assignment 3: Prime or Not

Take input from the user and find out if that number is prime or not.
