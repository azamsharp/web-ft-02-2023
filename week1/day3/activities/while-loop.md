# Activity 4 - While Loop 

In this activity, you are going to enter your friend's name using the `input` function continuously inside a while loop. The while loop will end when the user enter "q" (without quotes) to quit.

Also make sure to add your friend's name to an array and print the array after right after the end of while loop. 

```
while(some condition): 
    code ...
    code ...

print(friends) # friends is an array 
```
