# Activity 1 - Insert TodoItem 

In this activity you are going to create a NodeJS app, which will allow the user to save a new TodoItem to the MongoDB database. All the items are saved to the **"tasks"** collection in MongoDB database.

Here are the details: 

Route:  `/add-item`
Body: 
```
taskName: String 
taskPriority: String 
```

**You can use POSTMAN to insert an item to the MongoDb database.**
